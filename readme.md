# CordovaMyConsole

a cordova plugin for logging on ios.
adds log method on the window object.
quickly hacked because the native cordova implementation has stopped working consistently in one of my projects.

## installation

			cordova plugin add $pathToRepo/plugin

## license

apache license (same as cordova)
