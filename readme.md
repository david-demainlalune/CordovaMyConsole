# CordovaMyConsole

a cordova ios only plugin for logging.
adds log method on the window object (redirects to NSLog on native side).
quickly hacked because the native cordova implementation has stopped working consistently in one of my projects.

## installation

			cordova plugin add $pathToRepo/plugin

## license

apache license (same as cordova)
